Hello, and welcome to my personal academic website.

I am Gaspard Beaudouin, a second year Master's student at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, Institut Polytechnique de Paris.  
My research interests lie in flow matching / diffusion models, large language models and unified models.

Previously, I interned at Sinequa in Paris, working on agentic capabilities of large language models. Recently, I joined Harvard AI and Robotics Lab, working on flow matching for text-to-image editing.
